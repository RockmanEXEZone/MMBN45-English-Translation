###Script:1
BattleChips are
like the nuts
of the tree
###++++++++
that is the
Data Library.
###--------
I wonder what
kind of nuts are
in the libraries
###--------
of your friends
at <printSchool>⋯
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:2
Collecting chips
isn't all that
different from
###--------
squirrels gathering
nuts preparing
for hibernation...
###--------
I'm sure there are
plenty of squirrels
at <printSchool>,too.
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:3
I wonder if there
are any operators
at <printSchool>
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
who have chips
that you've
never seen...
###--------
###Script:5
It feels good to
be in a place
###++++++++
as vast and open
as the Net...
###--------
Surely,your big
brother <printOlderBro>
###Command:printOlderBro capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
is a person with
a heart as big
as the Net...
###--------
###Script:6
<printPlayerNickname>,why not
show me how big
your heart is
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
by allowing your
little brother
<printYoungerBro>
###Command:printYoungerBro capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
to operate
me every now
and then...?
###--------
###Script:7
The plants that
grow on the Net
soothe my heart.
###--------
I imagine
<printOlderSis>'s
kindness
###Command:printOlderSis capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
soothes your
heart as well...
###--------
###Script:8
<printPlayerNickname>,why not
teach <printYoungerSis>
how to NetBattle?
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printYoungerSis capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###--------
If you do,it might
really spruce up
your daily life.
###--------
###Script:9
Battles provide
nutrients that
grow friendships.
###--------
Be sure to nurture
your friendship
with <printFriend>⋯
###Command:printFriend capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:10
Does <printFriend>
have any chips
that you don't?
###Command:printFriend capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I'm sure they
would be happy to
share with you...
###--------
###Script:11
<printPlayerNickname>,instead
of NetBattling
all day,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
why don't you
go hiking with
<printFriend>?
###Command:printFriend capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:13
You might get
hungry after using
the Net,<printPlayerNickname>,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
but you shouldn't
eat too much
<printFavFood>.
###Command:printFavFood capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Unless you want
to get lips
like mine...
###--------
###Script:14
You might get
hungry after using
the Net,<printPlayerNickname>,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
but you shouldn't
eat too much
<printFavFood>.
###Command:printFavFood capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Unless you want
to get a belly
like mine...
###--------
###Script:15
I'm not happy
with the way my
belly sticks out...
###--------
Perhaps I should
exercise on the
Net a bit more...
###--------
Remember...
Moderation in all
things,<printPlayerNickname>.
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Be careful not
to eat too much
<printFavFood>.
###Command:printFavFood capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:17
By the way,
<printPlayerNickname>,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
you don't plan on
doing <printHobby>
today?
###Command:printHobby capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I'm quite a fan,
you know...
###--------
###Script:18
If you practice
<printHobby> two
hours every day,
###Command:printHobby capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
you might grow
better at
getting chips.
###--------
###Script:19
The secret to both
chip collecting
and <printHobby>
###Command:printHobby capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
is to work on
them a little
bit every day...
###--------
###Script:21
From what I could
tell from that
battle just now...
###--------
The road to being
a<printDream> <printDream> is
still a long one...
###Command:printDream printN=true
###Command:printDream capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:22
The experiences
you gained in
this tournament
###++++++++
will make for a
good fertilizer,
as you continue
###--------
to grow towards
becoming a<printDream>
<printDream>.
###Command:printDream printN=true
###Command:printDream capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:23
Whether it's
battling or
something else,
###++++++++
it's important
to have a
fiery passion.
###--------
That also goes
when you're
striving towards
###++++++++
becoming a<printDream>
<printDream>⋯
###Command:printDream printN=true
###Command:printDream capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
But don't get too
heated up,or you'll
really catch fire...
###--------
###Script:25
Why don't you send
mail to <printCrush>
###Command:printCrush capitalizeFirst=false
###++++++++
asking them out
on a date?
###--------
Hm...? What is that
face you're making?
###--------
You have some
red berries on
your cheeks...
###--------
###Script:26
You're getting
plenty of mail,but...
###--------
it must be tiresome
to get these formal
mails all the time.
###--------
Every now and
then,it would
be nice
###++++++++
to get some mail
from <printCrush>.
###Command:printCrush capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:27
<printPlayerNickname>,could you
ask <printCrush>
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printCrush capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
to send a mail
sometime?
###--------
...To me,that is!!
###--------
###Script:29
An incoming mail is
like a bird flying
into a large tree...
###--------
No matter what
kind of bird
may fly in,
###++++++++
the tree will
accept them all.
###--------
Although,if the
mail were from
<printPlayerEnemy>⋯
###Command:printPlayerEnemy capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:30
Looking at mail all
day is tiresome...
Instead,
###--------
maybe we should
think of a way to
beat <printPlayerEnemy>⋯
###Command:printPlayerEnemy capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
...In a NetBattle,
of course.
###--------
###Script:31
It's said that
a tree is known
by its fruit.
###--------
If you were to
read some mail
from <printPlayerEnemy>,
###Command:printPlayerEnemy capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
you might find
out what kind of
person they are.
###--------
###Script:33
Battles really light
a fire in your
heart,don't they?
###--------
If you need to calm
your heart again,
watch <printFavShow>⋯
###Command:printFavShow capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:34
If you'd like to
study NetBattling
techniques,
###--------
<printFavShow> is a
good show to watch.
###Command:printFavShow capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:35
Why don't we
rest for a while?
......
###--------
Jumping around
with this body gets
rather exhausting...
###--------
A-Ah yes...
Why don't we watch
some <printFavShow>?
###Command:printFavShow capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
...Not now?
###--------
###Script:37
Browsing the Data
Library brings
back memories,
###--------
of difficult battles
and jolly times...
###--------
Like <printIdol>'s
face that one time...
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
...You don't
think so?
###--------
###Script:38
You tend to get
more emotionally
attached to chips
###++++++++
that you obtained
through your
own hard work.
###--------
That goes for the
chips <printIdol>
gave you,too.
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
...Though I'm not
sure if <printIdol>
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###++++++++
ever did give
you any chips...
###--------
###Script:39
It's fun to
look at various
types of chips...
###--------
I wonder what
kind of chips
<printIdol> likes...?
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
If I had to wager
a guess from just
looking at them,
###--------
I think <printIdol>
is fond of hard-
hitting MegaChips...
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:41
Hm! Your operating
today was quite
splendid.
###--------
It would seem your
<printBestSubject> skill
isn't just for show.
###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:42
The layout of the
Net branches out
like a tree's roots.
###++++++++
If you want to
understand its
full topology,
###--------
I think <printBestSubject>
knowledge might
come in handy.
###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Well,it may
not always...
###--------
###Script:43
In the Cyberworld,
every day is full
of new surprises.
###--------
The secret to
dealing with any
sort of situation
###--------
lies in cultivating
your <printBestSubject>
abilities.
###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
...Though that
may not always
be the case...
###--------
###Script:45
There is more to
being an operator
###--------
than just being
good at battling...
###--------
It's also
necessary to be
knowledgeable.
###--------
Including about
<printWorstSubject>⋯
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:46
There are all
kinds of Navis
on the Net,
###--------
but if you aim to
be the strongest
of the Cyberworld,
###--------
then you surely
can't do without
<printWorstSubject>.
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:47
<printPlayerNickname>,if only
you would come to
like <printWorstSubject>
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
a little bit,the
Net might become
much more fun.
###--------
###Script:49
As I thought...
All of the Navis
participating
###++++++++
in the tournament
are no slouch.
###--------
Maybe we should
borrow the power
of a<printWish> <printWish>?
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:50
If you continue to
put in the effort,
you won't just
###--------
obtain 1st place in
the tournament,but
a<printWish> <printWish>,too.
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
The important part
is that you keep up
your best efforts.
###--------
###Script:51
<printPlayerNickname>,you
need to try
and remain
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
a little calmer
while battling.
###--------
If you had
a<printWish> <printWish>,
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
perhaps that would
put your mind at
ease during battle...
###--------
###Script:53
You haven't
gotten any mail
from <printMostFrequentOpponent>.
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I suppose it's not
easy to send mail
to your rival...
###--------
###Script:54
You can tell a
person's character
from their mail.
###--------
Now,I've never
read any mail
from <printMostFrequentOpponent>,
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
but they probably
have a calm
personality.
###--------
Even without seeing
mail from them,I
can tell that much...
###--------
###Script:55
You must be tactful
both when battling
and writing mail
###--------
When you exchange
mail with <printMostFrequentOpponent>,
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
approach it with
the same care as
you would a battle.
###--------
###Script:57
When it comes
to making a
ChipFolder,
###--------
you should carefully
consider the
personalities
###++++++++
and compatibilities
of every chip.
###--------
<printLostToOpponent> has a
good grasp of each
chip's personality...
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
It's plain to see
just by looking
at their chips.
###--------
###Script:58
A well-built Chip-
Folder is like the
trunk of a tree.
###--------
If I had to compare
<printLostToOpponent>'s folder
to a tree...
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I think a giant
sequoia would
be perfect.
###--------
###Script:59
Our equipment is
nothing to shake
a stick at,is it?
###--------
We should have no
trouble fighting on
<printLostToOpponent>'s level.
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:61
With BattleChips,
what's important is
how you use them.
###--------
For example,
<printMostLostToOpponent> is an
expert at using
###Command:printMostLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
<printMostLostToOpponentsChip>. You
should learn
from them!
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:62
It's best to build
a battle strategy
around a core chip...
###--------
How about a chip
like <printMostLostToOpponentsChip>⋯?
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:63
I get the feeling
our current folder
is a bit unbalanced.
###--------
Why not try putting
in <printMostLostToOpponentsChip> and
see how it goes?
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:65
For some reason,my
body feels somewhat
heavy lately...
###--------
Maybe we ought
to battle <printDefeatedOpponent>
or something
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
to help get me
a little more
in shape...
###--------
###Script:66
When battling,you
must stand firm
like a tall tree.
###--------
Unstable footing
like <printDefeatedOpponent>'s
can easily
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
turn a winnable
battle into an
unwinnable one...
###--------
###Script:67
If you plant your
roots firmly
into the ground,
###--------
few attacks
will be able
to shake you.
###--------
<printDefeatedOpponent> still
lacks this...
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
###Script:69
I can't say for
sure that it'll
help in battle,
###--------
but it may be
interesting to try
using <printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip>.
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:70
There is this chip
called <printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip>⋯
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It has somewhat
of a lackluster
personality,but if
###--------
you understand its
nature well,you can
use it effectively.
###--------
###Script:71
When a battle
ends up turning
into a logjam...
###--------
If you can use
<printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip> to its
full effect,
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
you might be
able to turn
the tables...
###--------
###Script:73
Maybe you won't
understand
this,<printPlayerNickname>,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
but <printFavStandardChip1>
fills me with a
strange warmth...
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:74
Just as humans
have various
personalities,
###--------
each chip,too,has
its own unique
personality.
###--------
Amongst them...
<printFavStandardChip1> is a
good,honest chip.
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:75
If you fully
understand a
chip's personality,
###--------
it can unleash
even more power
than you thought.
###--------
In particular,
<printFavStandardChip1> always
tries its best.
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:77
Even with chips,
you can grow
attached to them
###++++++++
if you use them
for a long time...
###--------
Those feelings will
likely get through
to the chip,too...
###--------
I think <printFavStandardChip2>
can understand,
somehow...
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:78
Even if a chip is
weak on its own,
###--------
there are plenty
of other chips
###--------
you can combine
it with to make
it stronger...
###--------
<printFavStandardChip2> is one
of those chips.
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
###Script:79
<printFavStandardChip2> has a
gentle personality.
It gets along well
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
with other chips,
so it should be
easy to use...
###--------
###Script:81
Among all of the
chips in the
Data Library,
###++++++++
<printFavStandardChip3> can be
an especially
stubborn chip.
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
But...if you can
understand its
personality,
###--------
it can be a lovely
chip that will put
in plenty of work.
###--------
###Script:82
Combining two chips
that don't get
along too well
###++++++++
will give you
a rather weak
result...
###--------
On the other hand,
consider <printFavStandardChip3>.
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It seems to get
along well with
any chip,
###--------
so you'll naturally
find plenty of
combos with it.
###--------
###Script:83
Looking at the
Data Library,
###++++++++
I think all
these chips are
quite lovely...
###--------
A stubborn chip like
<printFavStandardChip3> especially
has its charms.
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:85
MegaChips,compared
to Standard Chips,
are especially
###--------
stubborn...
They can be a
pain to deal with.
###--------
At least <printFavMegaChip>
usually cooperates...
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:86
<printFavMegaChip> has a
habit of not
going together
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
too well with
the other
MegaChips.
###--------
But those times
it combines with
a Standard Chip,
###--------
it shows amazing
power...
###--------
###Script:87
I think <printFavMegaChip>
tries its hardest
to fit in with
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
the other chips...
That's a good
attitude to have.
###--------
###Script:89
Even just from
looking at it in
the Data Library,
###--------
I feel incredible
power coming
from <printFavGigaChip>⋯
###Command:printFavGigaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:90
GigaChips are chips
of destruction...
###--------
Among them,
<printFavGigaChip>'s power
is truly frightening.
###Command:printFavGigaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:91
Preferably,I'd like
to win battles
###--------
without relying on
<printFavGigaChip>'s power...
###Command:printFavGigaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
