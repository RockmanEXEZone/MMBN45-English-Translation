Error!
Put info in
the form!
###--------
###Script:1
According to my
calculations,
###--------
the possibility
that someone
at <printSchool>
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
has more chips
than us is
extremely high.
###--------
###Script:2
<printPlayerNickname>,please
let me accompany
you to <printSchool>.
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I'm interested
in finding out
###--------
what kinds of
chips other
NetBattlers use.
###--------
###Script:3
Why not try some
battles with people
at <printSchool>,
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
where you each
put your Battle-
Chips on the line?
###--------
###Script:4
According to my
information,when
it comes to who
###--------
has the most chips
among everyone
at <printSchool>⋯
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###++++++++
You place 3rd,
<printPlayerNickname>.
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:5
Stay on your
guard,<printPlayerNickname>.
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I continue to sense
a strong presence
on the Net...
###--------
Should we inform
<printOlderBro> as well?
###Command:printOlderBro capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:6
<printPlayerNickname>,
I have a report!
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
I've calculated
the probability
###++++++++
of encountering
viruses on the Net.
###--------
Let's inform
<printYoungerBro> as well!
###Command:printYoungerBro capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:7
Net recon is
a vital part...
###--------
of planning out a
proper strategy.
###--------
Let's ask
<printOlderSis> to be
our advisor.
###Command:printOlderSis capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:8
It's true,there
are a lot of
Navis on the Net.
###--------
Keep your eyes
open,<printPlayerNickname>.
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
You never know
where an enemy
might be hiding.
###--------
Let's urge
<printYoungerSis> to be
careful as well.
###Command:printYoungerSis capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:9
For a sniper,I'd
say communication
is crucial.
###--------
It's difficult to
gauge whether
###++++++++
we should prioritize
<printFriend>,though...
###Command:printFriend capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:10
When you're having
a Network Duel
against <printFriend>,
###Command:printFriend capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
make sure to mind
your manners!
###--------
You wouldn't want
your relationship
to become strained.
###--------
###Script:11
Is it true that a
Network Duel is all
but guaranteed to...
###--------
improve relations
between you and
your opponent?
###--------
Is that how you
and <printFriend>
became close,too?
###Command:printFriend capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
That's not how our
missions usually go...
###--------
###Script:13
After you finish
up on the Net,
###++++++++
I'd advise giving
yourself proper
nutrition.
###--------
How about having
some <printFavFood>?
###Command:printFavFood capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:14
Even during a
mission,we often
eat <printFavFood>.
###Command:printFavFood capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
After all,it's
packed full of
essential nutrients.
###--------
###Script:15
I'll search the
Net right away,
###--------
for info on the
world's tastiest
<printFavFood>!
###Command:printFavFood capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:17
<printPlayerNickname>,whenever
you're doing
<printHobby>⋯
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printHobby capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
your eyes shine
with a bright glow.
###--------
It's just like a
sniper aiming
at their mark.
###--------
###Script:18
<printHobby> is just
like our missions.
###Command:printHobby capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
The part where you
line up your aim
is fairly similar.
###--------
###Script:19
Time just slips
away when you're
doing <printHobby>⋯
###Command:printHobby capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
That won't fly
during a mission,
though...
###--------
###Script:21
It's important
to set goals.
###--------
If you don't pick a
clear target,sniping
will be difficult.
###--------
Treat becoming a<printDream>
<printDream> with
the same care.
###Command:printDream printN=true
###Command:printDream capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:22
When sniping,you
have to line up
your shot properly.
###--------
Aiming to become a<printDream>
<printDream> boils
down to the same.
###Command:printDream printN=true
###Command:printDream capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:23
The kinds of Battle-
Chips you can use
are innumerable,
###--------
but you can't
let that distract
you in battle.
###--------
Being open for
even a second
can be fatal.
###--------
Exercise caution
when aiming to be
a<printDream> <printDream>,too.
###Command:printDream printN=true
###Command:printDream capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:25
Our next
target will be...
###--------
<printCrush>'s
heart.
###Command:printCrush capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
This mission will
be more important
than any before it.
###--------
###Script:26
Standby for my
report on our
present situation...
###--------
There is a
possibility that
<printCrush>
###Command:printCrush capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
is interested in
you,<printPlayerNickname>!
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
But,ultimately,
it's only a
possibility...
###--------
###Script:27
Red alert! We have
an emergency!!
###--------
<printCrush> just
looked this way!
###Command:printCrush capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
...My bad.
Seems like I mixed
up the intel.
###--------
###Script:29
You don't seem
to exchange a lot
###--------
of mail with
<printPlayerEnemy>,
<printPlayerNickname>.
###Command:printPlayerEnemy capitalizeFirst=false
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I think it'd be
better to communi-
cate more often.
###--------
Going it alone can
spell doom for you
during a mission...
###--------
###Script:30
Mail is the best
way to transmit
reliable intel.
###--------
Why not send
some mail to
<printPlayerEnemy>⋯
###Command:printPlayerEnemy capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
and clear up any
misunderstandings
between you two?
###--------
###Script:31
Teamwork is of
vital importance
in the army.
###--------
Why don't you
send <printPlayerEnemy>
some mail and
###Command:printPlayerEnemy capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
strengthen your
teamwork?
###--------
###Script:33
My reconnaissance
has revealed...
###--------
That <printFavShow>
is currently a hit
in the living room.
###Command:printFavShow capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:34
I don't think it's
good to watch
too much TV.
###--------
But if it's
<printFavShow>⋯
I guess it's fine.
###Command:printFavShow capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:35
Gathering as much
intel as you can
is highly beneficial.
###--------
<printFavShow> is a
precious source
of information,
###Command:printFavShow capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
so let's tune in
every week.
###--------
###Script:37
If we have trouble
completing our
mission,
###--------
let's ask
<printIdol> for
assistance.
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
They may be able
to do something
to help us.
###--------
###Script:38
There's something
different about
<printIdol>'s eyes.
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
They've got the
eyes of a sniper;
###--------
with a wide field
of vision that
sees everything...
###--------
###Script:39
It seems like
<printIdol>'s
teachings
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###++++++++
will come in handy
during battle.
###--------
Let's be sure
to thank them
next time.
###--------
###Script:41
If the results
of my recon
are correct...
###--------
Your <printBestSubject>
abilities are
###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
second to none on
the Net,<printPlayerNickname>.
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:42
What snipers need
is concentration
and a steady aim.
###--------
In other words,the
same essentials
as <printBestSubject>.
###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:43
<printPlayerNickname>,viruses
may attack on
the Net,but...
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
with <printBestSubject>
abilities like yours,
###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
we have nothing
to fear.
###--------
###Script:45
If you have things
you're bad at,
###--------
this may lead
to complications
during missions.
###--------
Might be a good
idea to master
<printWorstSubject>
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
while you still
have the time...
###--------
###Script:46
Finding the enemy's
weaknesses is the
core of any mission.
###--------
Watch out with
your <printWorstSubject>,
<printPlayerNickname>.
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:47
Everyone hides
their weaknesses
on the Net.
###--------
Having your weak-
ness exposed can
be fatal,after all!
###--------
So do all you can,
<printPlayerNickname>,to stop
your enemies
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
from discovering
your <printWorstSubject>
weakness...
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:49
What'll be the
target for our
next mission?
###--------
Conquer more
tournaments,or find
a<printWish> <printWish>?
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:50
My calculations
indicate there are
about as many
###--------
people aiming
to conquer the
tournament,
###--------
as there are
people who want
a<printWish> <printWish>.
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
But unlike them,
WE actually have
a shot at victory...
###--------
###Script:51
Just like trying
to conquer the
tournament...
###--------
The mission of
obtaining a<printWish>
<printWish>
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
is no straight-
forward matter.
###--------
The rest is all up
to the strength
of your passion.
###--------
###Script:53
Even if we're
facing someone like
<printMostFrequentOpponent>'s Navi...
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
My aim will never
lose focus.
###--------
###Script:54
My scan of
<printMostFrequentOpponent> reveals
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
that their Net-
Battle strategies
are formidable.
###--------
I'd expect no less
from our rival.
###--------
###Script:55
Collecting data
on opponents is a
specialty of mine...
###--------
I'll begin gathering
info on <printMostFrequentOpponent>.
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:57
It appears that
<printLostToOpponent> excels at
detecting enemies.
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
We need to be
careful not to give
away our position...
###--------
###Script:58
Whenever we
battle <printLostToOpponent>⋯
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
it feels like
my predictions
never work out.
###--------
I might have to
restart my scan...
###--------
###Script:59
When we battle
with <printLostToOpponent>,
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
my lock-on always
ends up missing.
###--------
Could it be that
they can predict
our actions?
###--------
###Script:61
<printMostLostToOpponent>'s usage
of <printMostLostToOpponentsChip> seems
very impressive.
###Command:printMostLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###--------
In order for
us to use this
as reference...
###--------
I'd like to
begin my scan
immediately.
###--------
###Script:62
My probe into
the secret to
<printMostLostToOpponent>'s power...
###Command:printMostLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
concludes that it's
mainly due to their
<printMostLostToOpponentsChip> chip.
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It might do us
good to try
using it as well.
###--------
###Script:63
<printMostLostToOpponent>'s Navi
has no openings
I can lock-on to...
###Command:printMostLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
Now that's a role
model any battler
can look up to.
###--------
They may be our
rival,but I have
to admire them.
###--------
###Script:65
There's no need
to run a scan on
<printDefeatedOpponent>'s Navi...
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
A glance was all it
took for me to spot
their weakness.
###--------
###Script:66
According to
my scan of
<printDefeatedOpponent>'s Navi...
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
They're still
just a rookie.
###--------
It'd be good to
suggest they do
more Network Duels.
###--------
###Script:67
We shouldn't
take <printDefeatedOpponent>
for granted.
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It's not uncommon
that a NetBattle
###--------
takes a turn for
the unexpected...
###--------
###Script:69
Based on my
analysis of our
Network Duels...
###--------
it seems like
not many Navis
use <printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip>.
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:70
Using equipment
that's well-suited
for you is
###--------
a fast track
to completing
your mission.
###--------
It seems <printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip>
doesn't suit
<printMostDefeatedOpponent> that well.
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
The data in our
battle records
makes that clear...
###--------
###Script:71
Analysis of our
Network Duels
seems to indicate...
###--------
the outcome of a
battle hinges on
<printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip>'s usage.
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Maybe we ought
to report this to
<printMostDefeatedOpponent> as well...
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:73
<printFavStandardChip1> is
indispensable
in our missions.
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
Please make sure
to always have it
in our ChipFolder.
###--------
###Script:74
Use <printFavStandardChip1> to
stop the enemy in
their tracks,then
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
lock-on right away!
That's a ticket
to victory.
###--------
###Script:75
There's something
assuring about
using <printFavStandardChip1>⋯
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It's got a feeling
like no other chip.
###--------
Maybe it can be
useful for boosting
our morale.
###--------
###Script:77
According to my
scan,battlers that
use <printFavStandardChip2>⋯
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
are not
very common.
###--------
Personally,I'm
partial to it,
though...
###--------
###Script:78
<printFavStandardChip2> is
somewhat
inconspicuous...
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
but that sort of
chips is valuable
during missions.
###--------
###Script:79
While browsing
through the
Data Library...
###--------
For some reason,
<printFavStandardChip2> seems
to stick out.
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
We'll need to
do further
investigation...
###--------
###Script:81
For some reason,
while running a
scan on enemies...
###--------
<printFavStandardChip3> popped
into my mind,
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
but I don't yet
understand the
reason...
###--------
I'll report back
promptly after
I investigate.
###--------
###Script:82
Trying to use
<printFavStandardChip3> seems
to be difficult.
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It might even
compromise your
calculations...
###--------
###Script:83
Going by the
results of my
investigation...
###--------
Hard to say how
well <printFavStandardChip3> can
support my sniping.
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:85
According to
my analysis
of <printFavMegaChip>⋯
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It's the key chip
in raising our
chances of victory.
###--------
Let's plan out our
mission with this
data in mind.
###--------
###Script:86
<printFavMegaChip> is simple
to use and really
packs a punch.
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
Certainly something
we could use in
all of our missions...
###--------
It's a chip that
can be deployed
in any situation.
###--------
###Script:87
When the mission
is critical...
###--------
it would be a good
time to bring out
<printFavMegaChip>.
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It can eliminate
your enemies all
at once,after all...
###--------
###Script:89
<printFavGigaChip> is
too powerful,
###Command:printFavGigaChip capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
sometimes it
even causes
errors in my aim.
###--------
Caution is advised...
###--------
###Script:90
<printFavGigaChip>'s power
is out of this world.
###Command:printFavGigaChip capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
Exercise caution
when you handle it...
There's no telling
###--------
what kind of
collateral damage
it could cause...
###--------
###Script:91
There are a lot
of BattleChips out
there,but it's
###--------
clear <printFavGigaChip>'s
power surpasses
all the others.
###Command:printFavGigaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
No need for any
further analysis!
###--------
