Error!
Put info in
the form!
###--------
###Script:1
Look at how
the library
is filling up!
###--------
<printPlayerNickname>,I'm
certain your chip
collection ratio
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
is within the
top five at
<printSchool>!
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
There is no
mistaking it!
###--------
###Script:2
<printPlayerNickname>,there
is someone at
<printSchool>
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
who has even more
chips than you do,
is there not?
###--------
You cannot become
truly strong
without realizing
###++++++++
there is always
someone better
than you!
###--------
###Script:3
Regardless of how
many chips you
have,<printPlayerNickname>,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
it does not prove
that you're a
strong battler!
###--------
I am sure there
are some at
<printSchool>
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
who mistakenly
believe they
are strong,
###++++++++
just because they
have gathered a
great many chips!
###--------
###Script:5
Now,<printPlayerNickname>⋯
Next time,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I would like to
see <printOlderBro>'s
skill as well!
###Command:printOlderBro capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:6
Surely <printYoungerBro>
has inherited
###Command:printYoungerBro capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
your operating
techniques,
<printPlayerNickname>?
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Just once,I
would like to
see his skill!
###--------
###Script:7
<printPlayerNickname>,surely
<printOlderSis> must be
a splendid battler!
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printOlderSis capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###--------
I would be humbled
to be operated
by her someday!
###--------
###Script:8
<printPlayerNickname>,
is <printYoungerSis>
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printYoungerSis capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
not yet allowed
to use the Net,
perhaps?
###--------
I'm certain she
holds amazing
potential!
###--------
###Script:9
Victory or defeat,
I shall hold
no grudges!
###--------
A knight deepens
his friendships
through battle!
###--------
Someone like
<printFriend>
###Command:printFriend capitalizeFirst=false
###++++++++
will also make
a good knight
someday!
###--------
###Script:10
When a battle is
over,your friends'
faces come to mind...
###--------
I wonder what
<printFriend> is doing
at this moment...?
###Command:printFriend capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:11
Our opponents
just now were
on the same level
###--------
as <printFriend>⋯
No,perhaps
even better!?
###Command:printFriend capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
The Net is a vast
place,indeed...
###--------
###Script:13
Running around
on the Net makes
you grow hungry...
###--------
But if I were to
eat <printFavFood>,
###Command:printFavFood capitalizeFirst=false
###++++++++
my belly would
expand for sure!
###--------
###Script:14
Strolling around
an area you know
###++++++++
like the back of
your pocket is
very soothing...
###--------
It resembles the
feeling you get
when you eat
###--------
<printFavFood> made
by your mother,
<printPlayerNickname>⋯
###Command:printFavFood capitalizeFirst=false
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:15
In the end,virus
busting is all about
strength,<printPlayerNickname>!
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Eat <printFavFood>
to your heart's
content,
###Command:printFavFood capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
so that you may
build up plenty of
strength,<printPlayerNickname>!
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:17
As you amass more
chips,it's as if
the library is
###--------
blossoming with
flowers! It's
a noble cause.
###--------
Speaking of
nobility,<printPlayerNickname>,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
your hobby
<printHobby> is
quite noble as well!
###Command:printHobby capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:18
A proud library
full of tirelessly
collected chips...
###--------
Nothing gives
me greater
satisfaction.
###--------
When you are
doing <printHobby>,
###Command:printHobby capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I am sure you
feel the same,
<printPlayerNickname>!
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:19
Hmmm...
When I look
at the library,
###--------
my spirit yearns
for even more
chips!
###--------
You understand
how I feel,
do you not?
###--------
It's the same
feeling you get
after <printHobby>.
###Command:printHobby capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:21
Winning the
tournament is an
important goal,
###--------
but that is only
me speaking
as a knight...
###--------
But you,
<printPlayerNickname>,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
you hold an even
greater ambition
in your heart...
###--------
Namely,to achieve
your dream of being
a<printDream> <printDream>!
###Command:printDream printN=true
###Command:printDream capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:22
Oof... I suffered
some painful scars
in the tournament...
###--------
However! Each
and every one of
these scars were
###--------
sustained whilst
fighting alongside
you,<printPlayerNickname>⋯
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Whenever I receive
a new scar,if I
only remind myself
###--------
it brings <printPlayerNickname>
one step closer to
being <printDream>,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###Command:printDream capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I will gladly bear
these scars as
badges of honor!
###--------
###Script:23
We learned a lot
from the tournament
this time!
###--------
Be sure to use the
experience from
this tournament to
###--------
charge ahead on
the path to becom-
ing a<printDream> <printDream>!
###Command:printDream printN=true
###Command:printDream capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:25
Protecting those
you cherish is
a knight's duty!!
###--------
I am rather curious
where <printCrush>
could be right now...
###Command:printCrush capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
May I suggest
sending a mail to
check up on them...?
###--------
###Script:26
E-Mail certainly
is convenient!
###--------
I've heard that
in the past,
sending letters
###--------
would take quite
some time.
But with E-Mail,
###--------
your letter reaches
the other party
in an instant!
###--------
I shall send some
mail to <printCrush>
right away!
###Command:printCrush capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:27
<printPlayerNickname>,when
you send mail
to <printCrush>,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printCrush capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
shall I double-
check the
contents for you?
###--------
...Hmm,but that
is none of my
business,is it...
###--------
###Script:29
Any knight is
bound to make
some enemies...
###--------
Certainly,it's best
to have fewer
enemies,but...
###--------
Anyway,I suggest
I send some mail
to <printPlayerEnemy>
###Command:printPlayerEnemy capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
so we can gauge
their reaction...
......
###--------
...Don't get
involved,you say?
###--------
If that's what you
think,<printPlayerNickname>,
then I concede...
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:30
I am curious about
<printPlayerEnemy>'s
movements...
###Command:printPlayerEnemy capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
May I suggest I
send some mail to
check up on them...?
###--------
...Don't get
involved,you say?
###--------
If that's what you
think,<printPlayerNickname>,
then I concede...
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:31
Be on your guard
if you receive mail
from <printPlayerEnemy>⋯
###Command:printPlayerEnemy capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
...It might be a
trap,after all.
###--------
###Script:33
Lately,I feel as
though my body
###++++++++
is not very nimble
during battles...
###--------
Perhaps I should
study <printFavShow>
for diet ideas...
###Command:printFavShow capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:34
In recent days,our
battles have been
a dime a dozen...
###--------
Isn't there some
new battle strategy
we could employ?
###--------
Perhaps watching
<printFavShow> would
be insightful...
###Command:printFavShow capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:35
Tips to become
stronger in battle
###++++++++
can be found in
many different
places!
###--------
For instance,
surely <printFavShow>
contains some!
###Command:printFavShow capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:37
Perhaps chips are
not something we
collect,per se,
###++++++++
but instead,they
simply gather
on their own...
###--------
Much like how
people tend
to gather
###--------
around those who
are respected...
###--------
With someone
like <printIdol>,
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
surely both chips
and people would
gather naturally...
###--------
###Script:38
Every time the
library fills a
little further,
###--------
I feel as if we
are getting closer
to <printIdol>⋯
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:39
All the chips that
you've filled the
library with...
###--------
These chips are
proof of your
efforts,<printPlayerNickname>.
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I have confidence
<printIdol> sees
it the same way...
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:41
Lately,battles have
become more and
more satisfying!
###--------
It's all thanks to
your <printBestSubject>
skill,is it not?
###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:42
Fighting viruses
earlier convinced
me of one thing...
###--------
Battles are
not just about
power alone!
###--------
I'm only as strong
as I am now
###--------
thanks to your gift
for <printBestSubject>,
<printPlayerNickname>!
###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:43
<printPlayerNickname>,your
splendid operating
is reinforced
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
by your aptitude
for <printBestSubject>!
###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
If you gather
more knowledge,
I'm certain
###--------
you will be able
to battle even
more amazingly!
###--------
###Script:45
<printPlayerNickname>,there
are plenty of
places on the Net
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
where you can
improve your
battle technique,
###--------
but make sure to
study <printWorstSubject>
properly as well!
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
There is more to
being a knight
than just strength...
###--------
One must also
be educated to
a certain level!
###--------
###Script:46
I am not good at
dealing with certain
viruses on the Net...
###--------
But if there is
something you
are bad at,
###++++++++
it just means
you must build a
strategy for it!
###--------
<printWorstSubject>
is the same
way,<printPlayerNickname>!
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:47
The Net certainly
is heaps of fun!
###--------
There are so very
many opponents to
battle,after all!
###--------
<printPlayerNickname>,surely
there are many
battles for you
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
to take on in the
real world,too!
Like <printWorstSubject>!
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:49
That was a
fierce battle!
###--------
If we had a<printWish>
<printWish>,
perhaps we'd be
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###++++++++
able to battle
with a little
more leeway...
###--------
###Script:50
<printPlayerNickname>,please
try to obtain
a<printWish> <printWish>!
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
A<printWish> <printWish> is
something a knight
cannot do without!
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Having one or not
can make a world
of difference!
###--------
###Script:51
I am sure battles
will grow even more
difficult from now...
###--------
It may be a good
idea to obtain
a<printWish> <printWish>
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
in order to
prepare for our
future battles.
###--------
###Script:53
You cannot become
strong just by
reading mail.
###--------
In our current
condition,
###++++++++
I am not sure
we can defeat
<printMostFrequentOpponent>⋯
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
All we can do is
remain steadfast!
Let us do our best!
###--------
###Script:54
I had a thought
whilst we were
reading mail...
###--------
It is no good to
just aimlessly fight
battle after battle.
###--------
Unless we fight
with purpose
every time,
###--------
we will certainly
lose to <printMostFrequentOpponent>!
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:55
<printPlayerNickname>,absorbing
everything
around you,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
and using it to
improve yourself
###--------
is the mark of
an excellent
NetBattler...
###--------
By that logic,you
must be sure
###++++++++
to carefully read
the contents of
every mail!
###--------
I have no doubt
<printMostFrequentOpponent> is also
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
reading their
mail thoroughly...
###--------
......
We cannot afford
to lose to them!
###--------
###Script:57
Speaking of
equipment,
###--------
I would like for
<printLostToOpponent> to show
us theirs sometime.
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Perhaps then we'll
understand the key
to their strength.
###--------
###Script:58
<printPlayerNickname>,if you
long for victory,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
you should start
by training daily
###--------
and carefully
reinforcing your
equipment!
###--------
As for <printLostToOpponent>'s
training regimen
and equipment...
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I don't see any
flaws in either.
###--------
We mustn't
lose,either...
###--------
###Script:59
It could be said
that a battle has
already begun
###--------
the moment you
start thinking about
your equipment.
###--------
<printLostToOpponent> owes
their strength
to knowing this.
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
Do you understand?
###--------
###Script:61
Will our current
equipment be
sufficient?
###--------
When we battle
with <printMostLostToOpponent>,
###Command:printMostLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
there is no that
doubt they will
use <printMostLostToOpponentsChip>.
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
We must devise
a countermeasure...
###--------
###Script:62
Apologies for bring-
ing this up right
after you changed
###--------
our equipment,but
I recommend the
chip "<printMostLostToOpponentsChip>"!
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I would strongly
suggest you place
it into the folder!
###--------
###Script:63
Have you finished
with our equipment?
###--------
I feel a slight
unease with our
current equipment...
###--------
May I suggest
we put <printMostLostToOpponentsChip>
into our folder?
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
...Hm? You already
intended to put
it in!?
###--------
My apologies!
I should have
known my place!
###--------
###Script:65
I took a bit too
much damage in our
battle just now...
###--------
Had <printDefeatedOpponent>
been around to
see that battle,
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
they would surely
be roaring with
laughter...
###--------
Let us strengthen
our defenses a bit
better next time...
###--------
###Script:66
Even though we
just finished
a battle,
###--------
I feel like battling
<printDefeatedOpponent> for
some reason...
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
How curious...
###--------
###Script:67
After a battle
that left you
unsatisfied,
###--------
nothing gets rid of
that feeling like
fighting <printDefeatedOpponent>!
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:69
<printPlayerNickname>,allow
me to make a
suggestion...
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
How about we use
<printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip> in our
next battle?
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
<printMostDefeatedOpponent> might
believe they are
skilled with it,
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
but I believe you
would be able to
###--------
put it to even
better use,
<printPlayerNickname>⋯
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:70
If you seek a chip
to intimidate your
opponents with
###--------
in battle,then
I recommend
<printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip>!
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
There is no Navi
that could take
this chip head-on
###++++++++
and not be
scared witless!
###--------
###Script:71
That was a good
battle... However,
###--------
you are too gentle
when it comes to
finishing battles!
###--------
May I suggest
trying something
like <printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip>?
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Use it when you've
driven the opponent
into a corner,
###++++++++
and you will see
the effects
right away!
###--------
###Script:73
<printFavStandardChip1> is a
chip that tickles
a knight's heart!
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
It smells strongly
of chivalry!
###--------
###Script:74
After consulting
the library,
###--------
it seems <printFavStandardChip1>
was the chip we
used the most!
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:75
You could say
<printFavStandardChip1> is a chip
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
that shows your
personality,
<printPlayerNickname>!
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
No,no!
I did not mean
it in a bad way!
###--------
###Script:77
As we were looking
through the library,
###--------
I was reminded
of that one time
###--------
we missed with
<printFavStandardChip2> whilst
virus busting...
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
That was truly
regrettable...
###--------
###Script:78
<printFavStandardChip2> is
fundamental when
battling viruses.
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
Do you not think
so too,<printPlayerNickname>?
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
No,I am positive!
There is no
mistaking it!
###--------
###Script:79
There is this chip
called "<printFavStandardChip2>"...
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Its strength is
not so simple as
mere brute force.
###--------
That chip is hard
to use for someone
without technique!
###--------
###Script:81
There is this chip
called "<printFavStandardChip3>"...
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It's rather an
insignificant chip,
###--------
but we seem to
keep using it
for some reason...
###--------
Perhaps you have
a subconscious
interest,<printPlayerNickname>!
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:82
<printPlayerNickname>,your
technique is
recognizable to all!
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
But if you were
told to battle with
only <printFavStandardChip3>,
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###++++++++
that would certainly
be a different
story,wouldn't it!
###--------
###Script:83
<printPlayerNickname>,out of
all the chips there
are,if I asked
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
you to pick your
3rd favorite
Standard Chip...
###--------
Which would you
pick,I wonder?
###--------
Personally,I
would boldly
pick <printFavStandardChip3>!
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:85
Though they are
fewer in number
###--------
than Standard
Chips,MegaChips
have an impact
###--------
that Standard
Chips simply cannot
compare to!
###--------
In particular,
<printFavMegaChip> leaves a
strong impression!
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:86
If we only consider
the standard power
for MegaChips...
###--------
<printFavMegaChip> stands
out amongst
the bunch!
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:87
Whenever I
see the picture
for <printFavMegaChip>,
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I always become
enthralled by it!
###--------
###Script:89
MegaChips pale in
comparison to the
might of GigaChips.
###--------
And even among
them,it would be
no exaggeration
###--------
to say <printFavGigaChip>'s
power is truly
outrageous...
###Command:printFavGigaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:90
Every time we use
<printFavGigaChip>,I feel
my armor creaking...
###Command:printFavGigaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
So if possible,
please refrain
from using it...
###--------
###Script:91
I'm not sure if
even my armor
###--------
could withstand
a direct hit
from <printFavGigaChip>⋯
###Command:printFavGigaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It's certainly a
frightening chip...
###--------
