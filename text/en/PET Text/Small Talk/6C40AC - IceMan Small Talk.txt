What kind of chips

Hey,I know!

Let's go grab
something cold
to eat with her!
###--------
###Script:9

Let's go eat
some <printFavFood>,

so we're ready
for next time!

Don't forget to
study every now
and then,too!
###--------
###Script:19

Next time we
jack in,I'll yell:

"Anyone here

<printCrush> just
now,weren't you?

I get all
embarrassed for
some reason...
###--------
and my cheeks
turn all red!

...Don't get smart
with me & say they
were already red!
###--------
###Script:29
Try sending mail

sometime!

All of those
negative feelings
might melt away!

I can feel
how you're
###--------
giving <printPlayerEnemy>
the cold shoulder!

###--------
###Script:31
With mail,you can
say things that you
can't say out loud.
###--------
I'm sure you could
patch things up
with <printPlayerEnemy>,

###++++++++
if you send
them a mail.
###--------
###Script:33
I can't wait for
the next episode

What'll happen in
the next episode

I can never tell
what's going to
happen next!
###--------
###Script:35
What do you
talk about with
your friends
###++++++++
after you're done
NetBattling?
###--------
I bet you can't
help chatting
about <printFavShow>!

###--------
###Script:37
If we collect a

maybe <printIdol>
will show us their
Data Library!
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
So let's do
our best!
###--------
###Script:38
Keep working

But like

without effort,you

anything!
###--------
###Script:41

###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:45
You sure are jolly
when you're on
the Net,<printPlayerNickname>!

It's completely
different from
###++++++++
when you're
doing <printWorstSubject>!
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:46
It was kinda warm
on the Net today.
###--------
Sometimes things
just don't go the
way you want.
###--------
Learning to endure
<printWorstSubject> is one
of life's lessons!
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:47
Sometimes mystery
data is in hard
to find places.
###--------
You just have
to keep an eye
out for them.
###--------
Maybe the
good parts of
<printWorstSubject>
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
are also hidden
in hard to
find places...
###--------
You just have
to keep an eye
out for them.

###Script:49
People who are

tournaments or

###Mugshot:IceMan
get a<printWish> <printWish>

Getting too excited

get that heated
too,I wonder...?

filled with thoughts
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
about the
tournament,and
a<printWish> <printWish>.
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false

I love seeing
people strive
towards their goals!
###--------
###Script:53
Isn't it about time
we got some mail
from <printMostFrequentOpponent>?
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
After all,you two
are close enough
###++++++++
to have been
battling for
a long time.
###--------
Rivals must be
connected deep
in their hearts!
###--------
###Script:54
We've been meeting
a lot of new people
through mail lately!
###--------
<printPlayerNickname>,you
and <printMostFrequentOpponent>
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------

Network Duel,right?
###--------
###Script:55
What's the most
memorable mail you
ever received?
###--------
Was it a challenge
from <printMostFrequentOpponent>?
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I'm dying to know!
###--------
###Script:57
I feel <printLostToOpponent>'s
Navi is strong
against the cold!
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
We'll have to
use even colder
attacks!
###--------
###Script:58
Why is it so hard
for me to freeze
<printLostToOpponent>'s Navi?
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Ugh,this is making
me hot-headed!
###--------
There's snow way
I won't freeze
them next time!
###--------
###Script:59
I hate to admit
it,but <printLostToOpponent>
is really strong...
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
But if we were on
icy terrain,there's
no way I'd lose!
###--------
So how about
equipping
FreezeBomb?
###--------
###Script:61
I kinda don't like
that <printMostLostToOpponentsChip> chip
<printMostLostToOpponent> has!
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###Command:printMostLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I wanna ice it over
along with the rest
of their folder!
###--------
###Script:62
I want more
cold chips in
our ChipFolder!

My cool-as-ice
attacks won't lose

<printMostLostToOpponentsChip>!
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###Command:printMostLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:63
Equipment is about
balancing offense
and defense!
###--------
I think it'd be
even better if
we combined
###++++++++
our equipment
with <printMostLostToOpponentsChip>!
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:65
Network Duels are
a great way to get
better at battling!
###--------
Maybe we should
tell that to
<printDefeatedOpponent>,too!
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:66
Ahh...
I wanna have lots
of Network Duels...
###--------
How about we
invite <printDefeatedOpponent>?
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:67
You should give it
everything you've
got in a battle,
###++++++++
no matter who
the opponent is!
###--------
<printDefeatedOpponent> has
been really on the
ball lately,too!
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false

You know what they
say,being prepared
is half the battle!
###--------
###Script:69
You can really
see differences
###++++++++
in how each person
uses <printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip>.
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Try comparing how
<printMostDefeatedOpponent> uses it
to everyone else!
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:70
After all those
Network Duels,
it's plain to see!
###--------
Depending on
how you use it,
###++++++++
<printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip> can be
really powerful!
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
You should try
finding new ways to
use it,<printPlayerNickname>!
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:71
You can learn a
lot from watching
strong battlers.
###--------
I'm trying to
learn how to use
<printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip> properly.
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:73
<printFavStandardChip1>'s design
never disappoints!
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
That exquisite
choice of colors
is just the best!
###--------
###Script:74
I just can't get
enough of that
feeling you get
###++++++++
when you use
<printFavStandardChip1>!
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Ahh,this is a
problem...I'm going
to get addicted!
###--------
###Script:75
Among all the
chips in the
Data Library,
###--------
<printFavStandardChip1> is a
real eye-catcher.
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It's so beautiful,
like an ice crystal!
###--------
###Script:77
Whenever I look at
<printFavStandardChip2>,I feel
like I can relax...
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It must be our
lucky charm!
###--------
###Script:78
<printFavStandardChip2> really
stands out,huh?
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=true

Kinda makes you
want to use it,

You were staring

###Script:81
I'm kind of curious
about <printFavStandardChip3>⋯
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I feel like we've
only seen the tip
of the iceberg.
###--------
###Script:82
<printFavStandardChip3>'s design
doesn't look so
great.
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
But I feel like
it has potential...
###--------
Let's try using
it some more!
###--------
###Script:83
Without us even
realizing it,
###--------
<printFavStandardChip3> suddenly
showed up in
the folder!
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It must be fate
drawing us to it!
###--------
###Script:85
You need to choose
MegaChips in your
folder carefully.
###--------
Hmmmm...
###--------
Yeah,we probably
shouldn't take
<printFavMegaChip> out...
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=false
