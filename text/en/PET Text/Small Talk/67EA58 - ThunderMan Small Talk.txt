###Script:1
<printPlayerNickname>,your
library completion
is an important
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
deciding factor
for your status
as a NetBattler.
###--------
Is there anyone
at <printSchool> who
has filled their
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Data Library more
than you have?
###--------
###Script:2
Is the library
something people
boast about
###++++++++
to each other
at <printSchool>?
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
If so,you must
be sure to gather
plenty of chips.
###--------
###Script:3
Are you steadily
expanding your
chip collection?
###--------
Everyone at
<printSchool> is
trying hard,too...
###Command:printSchool capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:5
<printPlayerNickname>,do you
not go on the Net
with <printOlderBro>?
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printOlderBro capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I'm sure your
sibling bonds would
deepen if you did...
###--------
###Script:6
How about we go on
the Net together
with <printYoungerBro>⋯?
###Command:printYoungerBro capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
After all,<printYoungerBro>
is like a brother
to me as well...
###Command:printYoungerBro capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:7
Does <printOlderSis>
not use the Net?
###Command:printOlderSis capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Being your sister,
I'd assume she
has similar traits...
###--------
###Script:8
Say,<printPlayerNickname>.
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Does <printYoungerSis>
know how amazing
the Cyberworld is?
###Command:printYoungerSis capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
As long as she
knows,then I'm
satisfied...
###--------
###Script:9
Judging from your
operating in our
battle just now...
###++++++++
Looks like you
still have some
openings.
###--------
<printFriend> will not
hesitate to find
those openings...
###Command:printFriend capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
###Script:10
No matter the
outcome,friends
are still able to
###--------
exchange smiles
after a NetBattle.
###--------
<printFriend> is a
battler who can
do that.
###Command:printFriend capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
###Script:11
The more you fight,
the more your
friendships deepen.
###--------
Keep that in mind
as you battle.
###--------
Make sure to tell
<printFriend>,as well...
###Command:printFriend capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:13
Perhaps I used
a little too much
###++++++++
electricity on
the Net today...
###--------
I think I'll
recharge with
some <printFavFood>⋯
###Command:printFavFood capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
...Well,I suppose
that's not possible
for me,is it...
###--------
###Script:14
<printPlayerNickname>,let's
enjoy a meal of
<printFavFood> to
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printFavFood capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
prepare ourselves
for the next time
we jack in.
###--------
###Script:15
The electricity
that flows through
cyberspace is
###++++++++
delicious,but
at some point
I'd like to try
###--------
some human food,
especially
<printFavFood>.
###Command:printFavFood capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
But first,I'm
going to need
a mouth...
###--------
###Script:17
All done checking
the library...
###--------
How about some
<printHobby> now?
###Command:printHobby capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:18
Filling the library
is one way to
enjoy yourself.
###--------
But in terms
of enjoyment,
###++++++++
it's not nearly as
fun as <printHobby>.
###Command:printHobby capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:19
Chips are just
tools meant to
be used,right?
###--------
They're not very
useful when it
###++++++++
comes to
<printHobby>,though.
###Command:printHobby capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Hmm,but maybe if...
...No,probably not.
###--------
###Script:21
<printPlayerNickname>,use your
experience from
this tournament
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
and push forward
towards becoming
a<printDream> <printDream>.
###Command:printDream printN=true
###Command:printDream capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:22
That was an
intense battle...
###--------
<printPlayerNickname>,do not
forget about today.
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
In the future,when
you finally become
a<printDream> <printDream>,
###Command:printDream printN=true
###Command:printDream capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
today's experience
will surely come
in handy.
###--------
###Script:23
Now that the
tournament is over,
we can take a rest.
###--------
At times like this,
it doesn't hurt to
###--------
daydream a bit
and contemplate
the future.
###--------
Picture yourself
after becoming
a<printDream> <printDream>⋯
###Command:printDream printN=true
###Command:printDream capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:25
No matter how
cool and composed
you may be,
###--------
if you received
mail from
<printCrush>,
###Command:printCrush capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
it would certainly
leave you in shock...
###--------
###Script:26
Love is something
that zaps you like
###++++++++
a clumsy Elec-
based attack.
###--------
How about we
send some mail
to <printCrush>,
###Command:printCrush capitalizeFirst=false
###++++++++
hoping to make
them all tingly?
###--------
###Script:27
Doesn't seem you
got the mail you
were hoping for...
###--------
You know...
Mail from
<printCrush>⋯
###Command:printCrush capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:29
When we get mail
from <printPlayerEnemy>,
###Command:printPlayerEnemy capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I always feel
a weak jolt of
electricity
###--------
that tips me off...
###--------
If we get any,
I'll let you know
right away.
###--------
###Script:30
<printPlayerNickname>,would
you be annoyed if
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###++++++++
you received mail
from <printPlayerEnemy>?
###Command:printPlayerEnemy capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
...Hmmm,I see...
###--------
###Script:31
......
I've got a
strange feeling...
###--------
You may have
gotten mail
from <printPlayerEnemy>⋯
###Command:printPlayerEnemy capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:33
Now that we're
done battling,
###--------
there's no better
way to relax than
watch <printFavShow>.
###Command:printFavShow capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:34
After our battle
just now,if we
watch <printFavShow>,
###Command:printFavShow capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
we might be able
to enjoy it in
a new way.
###--------
...Possibly.
###--------
###Script:35
I spent too much
electricity in our
battle just now...
###--------
I must learn how
to better manage
###++++++++
my electricity
by watching
<printFavShow>⋯
###Command:printFavShow capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:37
Filling the library
is a kind of
training,too.
###--------
Even if your
methods are
different,
###--------
your spirit inches
ever closer to
<printIdol>⋯
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:38
I hope <printIdol>
is an avid chip
collector,too...
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:39
To collect chips
you need wisdom,
skill,and patience.
###--------
That's something
<printIdol> would
say as well.
###Command:printIdol capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Huh? They never
say that...?
###--------
Well,either way,
that's how it is.
###--------
###Script:41
The Cyberworld's
electricity has a
particular feeling...
###--------
Since you're good
at <printBestSubject>,
###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###++++++++
I'm sure you
understand too.
###--------
###Script:42
If you're
proficient in
<printBestSubject>,
###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
you'll find different
ways to have fun
on the Net.
###--------
###Script:43
You're already
done on the Net,
<printPlayerNickname>?
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###--------
Do you find
<printBestSubject> more
fun than the Net...?
###Command:printBestSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:45
You're already
done on the Net?
That must mean
###--------
you're studying
<printWorstSubject> next...
...I'm impressed.
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Wait...am I
mistaken?
###--------
###Script:46
The Net is all
about skill...
###--------
You won't have
too many issues
###++++++++
if you're bad
at,for instance,
<printWorstSubject>.
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
But,the fewer
weaknesses you
have,the better.
###--------
###Script:47
The Net is fun.
Despite that,it's
bad to overdo it.
###--------
You must make
some time to study
<printWorstSubject> too.
###Command:printWorstSubject capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:49
If I had just
a little more
electricity,
###--------
I think battles
would become
considerably easier.
###--------
I get the feeling
that <printWish>
you want
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
could probably
double my
electricity...
###--------
###Script:50
I used quite a
lot of electricity
in battle...
###--------
I must recharge
my electricity with
a<printWish> <printWish>⋯
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:51
Fierce battles
drain a lot of
electricity...
###--------
Say,<printPlayerNickname>.
When you're tired,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
do you rejuvenate
yourself with
a<printWish> <printWish>?
###Command:printWish printN=true
###Command:printWish capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:53
There was no
mail from your
rival,<printMostFrequentOpponent>.
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:54
If <printMostFrequentOpponent> ever
sends us mail
challenging us
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
to a battle,I'll
send them the
"OK" right away...
###--------
###Script:55
<printPlayerNickname>,try
exchanging battle
strategies with
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
<printMostFrequentOpponent> via
mail sometime...
###Command:printMostFrequentOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
You may be able
to pick up some
new things.
###--------
###Script:57
A battle already
starts when you
choose equipment...
###--------
To beat <printLostToOpponent>,
you must be
mindful of that.
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:58
We can definitely
win against
<printLostToOpponent>⋯
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
We just need to
prepare the best
folder we can,
###--------
choose the right
equipment to
match it,
###--------
and have you
operating in
peak condition.
###--------
###Script:59
With our current
equipment,
###++++++++
do we stand a
chance against
<printLostToOpponent>⋯?
###Command:printLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:61
Speaking of
equipment,
###--------
<printMostLostToOpponent> most
likely has <printMostLostToOpponentsChip>
in their folder.
###Command:printMostLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
That chip is
a tricky one...
###--------
###Script:62
Our folder right
now should be able
###--------
to deal with
<printMostLostToOpponent>'s
<printMostLostToOpponentsChip>⋯
###Command:printMostLostToOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:63
Which chips you put
in your ChipFolder
###++++++++
can turn the
tables in battle.
###--------
With our current
equipment,it might
be interesting
###--------
to consider putting
in a<printMostLostToOpponentsChip> <printMostLostToOpponentsChip>⋯
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip printN=true
###Command:printMostLostToOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:65
Going by our
battle just now,
###--------
your skills exceed
those of <printDefeatedOpponent>⋯
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:66
Regardless of
whether you
won or lost,
###--------
reflecting on your
battles will lead to
the next victory...
###--------
Tell that to
<printDefeatedOpponent> too...
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:67
<printPlayerNickname>,were
you not trying
your best in
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
our battle just
now? If you don't
try your best
###++++++++
in every battle,
you won't grow...
###--------
<printDefeatedOpponent> always
tries their best,
###Command:printDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=true
###++++++++
so they're sure
to grow stronger.
###--------
###Script:69
No matter how
powerful your
chips,<printPlayerNickname>,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
if the operator's
slot in timing
is poor,
###--------
the effectiveness
will be cut in half.
###--------
<printMostDefeatedOpponent>'s
<printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip> is a
good example...
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Be careful...
###--------
###Script:70
Something I think
about whenever
we battle...
###--------
It's important to
have an ace chip
or special attack.
###--------
<printMostDefeatedOpponent> is good
with <printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip>,
for example.
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=true
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It'd be good to
try out various
chips to find
###--------
the one that suits
you the most...
###--------
###Script:71
<printPlayerNickname>,if you
keep operating
like you just did,
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
even <printMostDefeatedOpponent>
will be able
to beat us...
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponent capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
If we get hit
by their special
<printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip> attack...
###Command:printMostDefeatedOpponentsChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Anyway,you mustn't
let your guard
down in any battle.
###--------
###Script:73
Something crossed
my mind as we were
viewing the library.
###--------
There's no other
chip we've gotten
as familiar with
###++++++++
as we have
with <printFavStandardChip1>⋯
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I'd like to keep
using it going
forward,as well...
###--------
###Script:74
It wouldn't be a
stretch to say
that <printFavStandardChip1>
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
is the chip you're
most skilled with,
<printPlayerNickname>.
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
After all,it's
the chip you use
most frequently...
###--------
###Script:75
Out of all the
Standard Chips,
###++++++++
the easiest one
to use is probably
<printFavStandardChip1>.
###Command:printFavStandardChip1 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Don't you think
so too,<printPlayerNickname>?
###Command:printPlayerNickname capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:77
While we were
going through
the Data Library,
###--------
one chip piqued
my interest:
<printFavStandardChip2>.
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Maybe I've sub-
consciously chosen
it as my favorite...
###--------
###Script:78
Out of all the
Standard Chips,
###++++++++
the flashiest
one is probably
<printFavStandardChip2>.
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
Don't you think so?
###--------
...Really?
###--------
###Script:79
Pinning down
your opponent
with <printFavStandardChip2>,
###Command:printFavStandardChip2 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
then finishing
them off with a
Mega-class chip...
###--------
That's an ideal
strategy...
###--------
###Script:81
I grew curious
whilst looking
at the library...
###--------
Even though I
don't particularly
like <printFavStandardChip3>,
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
I seem to end
up using it
subconsciously...
###--------
###Script:82
Electopian peppers
can make any
food spicy...
###--------
<printFavStandardChip3> is
just like that.
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
We should use
it to spice
up our folder!
###--------
###Script:83
<printFavStandardChip3> is
irreplaceable
in a NetBattle...
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
Without <printFavStandardChip3>,
you'd really be in
a tight spot,right?
###Command:printFavStandardChip3 capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
...You don't agree?
###--------
###Script:85
When you go through
all of the chips
in the library,
###--------
it sparks memories
of when you first
collected them.
###--------
For instance,
<printFavMegaChip> makes
me quite nostalgic.
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:86
Amongst all chips in
the Data Library,
<printFavMegaChip> is one
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
that holds the
power to change
the flow of battle.
###--------
If we spot an
opening,we mustn't
hesitate to use it...
###--------
###Script:87
<printFavMegaChip> is a
strong chip,but we
mustn't overuse it.
###Command:printFavMegaChip capitalizeFirst=true
###--------
OK? Be careful...
###--------
###Script:89
An opponent hit by
<printFavGigaChip> is surely
left helpless.
###Command:printFavGigaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
It even inflicts
a dreadful
mental impact
###++++++++
on the one
who uses it...
###--------
###Script:90
We've collected
all sorts of chips,
###--------
but chips as brutal
as <printFavGigaChip>
are a rarity...
###Command:printFavGigaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###--------
###Script:91
As I was looking
through the library,
###--------
it occurred to
me that <printFavGigaChip>
is one chip that
###Command:printFavGigaChip capitalizeFirst=false
###++++++++
I especially
wouldn't want
to get hit by...
###--------
